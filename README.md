# About

The goal here is to create ETL pipeline for real-estate property data in Belgium. The pipeline starts with extracting the data from real-estate websites,
continue with cleaning and preprocessing to make data ready for ML model. ML model takes the data and provides price prediction. The pipeline is managed with Apache Airflow and each task is designed as a separate Docker container.
